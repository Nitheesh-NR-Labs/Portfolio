  <section id="about" class="section">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am an Aerospace & Robotics Engineer with a strong focus on real-world
      engineering, system-level thinking, and hands-on development.
    </p>
    <p>
      My work spans high-power rocketry, UAVs, avionics, embedded systems,
      robotics, and experimental engineering projects. I enjoy working at the
      intersection of hardware and software — turning ideas into functional,
      testable, and scalable systems.
